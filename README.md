a calorie web scrapper
This script allows you to scrape food calorie information from a webpage using Python. It utilizes the requests library to fetch the webpage's HTML content and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract the desired information.

    requests library
    BeautifulSoup library

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the script file.
    Install the required libraries by running the following command:

    shell

    pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Usage

    Open the script file (calorie_counter_scraper.py) in a text editor.
    Modify the url variable in the scrape_calorie_counter function to contain the URL of the webpage you want to scrape. Make sure the URL is valid and contains the food calorie information you desire.
    Save the changes to the script file.
    Execute the script by running the following command:

    shell

python calorie_counter_scraper.py

The script will print the food items and their respective calorie counts found on the webpage.

    Make sure to provide a valid URL in the url variable to successfully scrape the desired food calorie information.
